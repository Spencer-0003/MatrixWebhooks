## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Matrix Webhook's code, please make sure it works on the newest commit before reporting it.<br/><br/>
If the vulnerability is dangerous/exploitable please DM me on Matrix (spencer:usesarchbtw.lol), if not feel free to use GitHub Issues or make a pull request to patch it yourself.
